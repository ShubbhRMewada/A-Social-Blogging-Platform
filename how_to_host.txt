Hello Proctors,
This file contains information on how to run the BLOG LITE website.

I have deleted the database before project submission so please follow the given steps for smooth execution of my project.

Step-0: 
Your Present working directory should be "\MAD-1 Project\Project Folder"
Please install all of the modules listed in "requirements.txt" using the following command
    "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Step-1:
Please use "cd \MAD-1 Project\Project Folder" and turn on the interactive python mode from your terminal.

Step-2:
Inside the interactive python mode use the following syntax:
    "from flaskblog.routes import db"
followed by
    "db.create_all()"

Step-3:
Exit the interactive python mode using "Ctrl-Z"

Step-4:
You will find a "run.py" file in your current working directory.
Run the "run.py" file and open the BLOG LITE website on the localhost suggested by the terminal.

Step-5:
Since the database is empty, you will be the first user.
Register yourself and perform all the functionalities you want to!

Thank you for your time!
I hope that you'll like my project.
